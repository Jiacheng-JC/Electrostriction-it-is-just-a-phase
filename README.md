This project is to simulate anharmonic oscillator pairs in one dimension, serving for the Nat. Comm. paper.
PDE_solver.py is the second ordinary differential equation with given parameters, the shape of potential a and k, damping coefficient c, driving frequency omega, and driving force amplitude F.
J_values_calculator.py can vary all the a,k,c,omega,F, to achieve the relation bewteen displacement x and driving force F.
Please carefully read the Supplymentary Information to understand why some certain values are selected.
