This project is to simulate anharmonic oscillator pairs in one dimension. 
SODE_Parameters_Given.py is the second ordinary differential equation with given parameters, the shape of potential a and k, damping coefficient c, driving frequency omega, and driving force amplitude F.
SODE_Parameters_Iterations.py can vary all the a,k,c,omega,F, to achieve the relation bewteen displacement x and driving force F.
